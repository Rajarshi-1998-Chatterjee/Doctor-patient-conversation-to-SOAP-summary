Assessment
62-year-old female with a history of hypothyroidism and eczema presents with an erythematous, scaly, and itchy rash that has been worsening over the past month. The rash is suggestive of an eczema flare-up, possibly exacerbated by hypothyroidism. Differential diagnosis includes psoriasis, given family history. 
Diagnosis: Eczema flare-up, potentially exacerbated by hypothyroidism.

Plan
Eczema flare-up, potentially exacerbated by hypothyroidism:
1. Prescribe a topical corticosteroid to reduce inflammation.
2. Recommend an antihistamine for the itching.
3. Order blood work to check thyroid levels.
4. Schedule a skin biopsy to confirm the diagnosis.
5. Advise to avoid hot showers and use hypoallergenic soaps.
6. Schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to reassess the condition.
7. Instruct the patient to come to the emergency room if the rash spreads significantly or if any other concerning symptoms arise.
