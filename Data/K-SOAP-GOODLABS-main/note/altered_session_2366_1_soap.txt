Assessment

Diagnosis: Possible dermatological condition, likely related to eczema or psoriasis.

1. Order lab work including CBC, liver function tests, and autoimmune panel.
2. Prescribe topical steroid cream to reduce inflammation and itching.
3. Refer to a dermatologist for further evaluation.
4. Follow-up in two weeks to review lab results and response to treatment.
5. Advise to keep the affected area clean and avoid known irritants.
6. Instruct patient to visit the emergency room if severe symptoms occur or the rash spreads rapidly.
