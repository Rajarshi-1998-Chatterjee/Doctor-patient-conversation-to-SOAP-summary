Assessment
A 29-year-old female with a history of acid reflux presents with sharp upper abdominal pain, fatigue, unintentional weight loss, and nausea. Symptoms and history suggest possible gastritis or peptic ulcer. No alarming signs on physical examination.

3. Recommend dietary changes, avoiding spicy and acidic foods.
4. Schedule a follow-up visit after receiving test results.
