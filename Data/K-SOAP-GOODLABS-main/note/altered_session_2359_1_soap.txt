Assessment
45-year-old male with no significant past medical history besides high cholesterol, presenting with anxiety and a persistent low mood, indicative of a major depressive episode with an anxiety component. Family history of depression and thyroid issues noted. Physical examination and review of systems are largely unremarkable, but the patient's affect and reported symptoms suggest a psychiatric etiology. Short-term memory impairment noted but no other neurological deficits.
Diagnosis: Major depressive episode with an anxiety component.

Plan
Major depressive episode with an anxiety component:
1. Lab work to rule out physical causes such as thyroid dysfunction.
2. Initiate pharmacotherapy with an antidepressant, such as sertraline.
3. Referral to a therapist for cognitive-behavioral therapy.
4. Follow-up visit in four weeks to monitor response to medication and therapy.
5. Instruct patient to seek immediate care in the emergency room if symptoms worsen or if thoughts of self-harm occur.
