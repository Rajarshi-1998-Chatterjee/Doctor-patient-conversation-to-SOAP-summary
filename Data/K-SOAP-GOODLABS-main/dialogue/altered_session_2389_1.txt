D: Good morning, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Aisha Patel. You're Mr. Abdul Khan, correct?

P: Yes, that's me. Good morning, Dr. Patel. How are you today?

D: I'm well, thank you for asking. And how should I address you during our session?

P: Please, just Abdul is fine.

D: Thank you, Abdul. Before we proceed, can you confirm your age for me? I want to ensure I have the correct file.

P: Of course, I'm 43 years old.

D: Wonderful, thank you. Now, tell me what brings you in today?

P: Well, for the past three weeks or so, I've been feeling increasingly anxious and I've noticed my mood has been quite low. I'm here because it's starting to affect my work and my relationships at home.

D: I see, that sounds challenging. You mentioned the symptoms started about three weeks ago. Have they been consistent since then, or have they gotten better or worse?

P: They've been pretty consistent, no real change in intensity, but definitely no improvement.

D: Have you experienced these symptoms before, or is this the first time?

P: This is the first time I've felt this way.

D: And can you describe the nature of your anxiety? Do you find it's triggered by specific events or thoughts?

P: It seems to come out of nowhere. I get these waves of worry about my job security and my family's future. It's this sense of dread that I can't shake off.

D: That sounds distressing. Are you having any trouble sleeping or concentrating because of these feelings?

P: Yes, my sleep is broken. I often wake up in the middle of the night worrying. And during the day, it's hard to focus on my tasks.

D: Have you noticed any changes in your appetite?

P: Now that you mention it, I've been eating less. Just not feeling as hungry as usual.

D: And have you had any thoughts of harming yourself or others?

P: No, nothing like that.

D: Okay, that's good to hear. Let's talk about your past medical history. Any chronic illnesses or previous hospitalizations?

P: I have type 2 diabetes and I was hospitalized once for pneumonia, but that was years ago.

D: Any known allergies?

P: Just penicillin.

D: And are your immunizations up to date?

P: Yes, though I think I'm due for a flu shot soon.

D: We'll make sure to address that. Any family history of psychiatric conditions?

P: My father suffered from depression, but no other known conditions in the family.

D: Could you tell me a bit about your occupation and lifestyle?

P: I'm an accountant, married with one child. I enjoy reading and playing chess. I don't smoke, but I do enjoy a glass of wine occasionally.

D: How about your current medications?

P: I take metformin for my diabetes, 500 mg twice daily.

D: Let's go through a review of systems. Any fevers, chills, or unexplained weight loss?

P: No, none of those.

D: Any congestion, runny nose, ear pain, or sore throat?

P: No, all clear there.

D: Chest pain or heart palpitations?

P: No chest pain, but I've had a few palpitations when I'm feeling particularly anxious.

D: Any cough or difficulty breathing?

P: No issues with breathing.

D: Any changes in urination or blood in the urine?

P: No, nothing unusual.

D: Any gastrointestinal issues like diarrhea, vomiting, or abdominal pain?

P: No gastrointestinal problems.

D: Any dizziness, headaches, or confusion?

P: No dizziness or confusion, but I've had a couple of tension headaches.

D: Any joint pains?

P: No joint pains.

D: Any intolerance to heat or cold?

P: No, I'm comfortable with temperature changes.

D: From a physical standpoint, you appear well, no signs of respiratory distress. Your affect is somewhat anxious but appropriate. No abnormalities on the head and neck exam. Your pupils are equal and reactive to light. Heart sounds are normal, no murmurs. Good air entry bilaterally, no wheezing. Abdomen is soft and non-tender, with normoactive bowel sounds. Neurologically, you're oriented to time and place, and your short-term memory is intact.

P: That's good to know.

D: Based on our discussion and my assessment, it seems you are experiencing symptoms of an anxiety disorder, possibly with an element of depression. I'd like to start you on a low-dose antidepressant, sertraline, 50 mg once a day, and refer you to a mental health professional for cognitive behavioral therapy.

P: Okay, I'm willing to try that.

D: Additionally, I'll order some routine blood work to check your glucose and A1C levels, given your diabetes, and a thyroid function test to rule out any physiological causes of your mood symptoms. Let's schedule a follow-up in a month to assess how you're doing with the medication and therapy. If at any point you feel overwhelmed or have thoughts of self-harm, please come to the emergency room immediately.

P: I understand, thank you, Dr. Patel.

D: You're welcome, Abdul. Here's a summary of our plan. We'll have the receptionist schedule your appointments and follow-up. Take care.

P: Thanks again. Goodbye, Dr. Patel.

D: Goodbye, Abdul.
