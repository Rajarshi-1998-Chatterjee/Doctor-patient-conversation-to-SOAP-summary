[uni/]   [speaker_2/]  I hope so, I mean you have to follow up with Doctor [person/] to make sure that no new abscess- [c_o/] [end_time: 00:03:22.741] [duration: 00:00:10.932] [start_time: 00:03:22.741] [speaker_1/]  [uni/] is developed that the the area that the [m_t/] appendix. I'm sorry I'm on the wrong side of my [o_s/]  [uni/]  [speaker_2/] Yeah. [speaker_1/] The area that the [m_t/] appendix is connected to [speaker_2/] yeah [speaker_1/] is the [m_t/] cecum that that part doesn't get irritated, [speaker_2/] yeah [speaker_1/] there is, you know everything is connected [speaker_2/] n- [c_o/] [end_time: 00:03:33.674] [duration: 00:00:08.628] [start_time: 00:03:33.674] [speaker_1/] So I'm not gonna s- I- I hope that this is the end of it but I can't say for certain. You definitely need a follow up with Doctor   [PERSON/]   [speaker_2/]  [fill/]  [speaker_1/] in the office and [fill/] [end_time: 00:03:42.303] [duration: 00:00:01.975] [start_time: 00:03:43.633] [speaker_1/]  Make  sure that this is- [c_o/] [end_time: 00:03:45.608] [duration: 00:00:03.619] [start_time: 00:03:48.809] [speaker_1/]  Okay, if you do have an [m_t/]  infection going on. [speaker_2/]  [v_n/] [end_time: 00:03:52.429] [duration: 00:00:05.644] [start_time: 00:04:08.214] [speaker_1/]  No, because the appendix is- Okay, imagine this is the seat belt it goes out of it, so [end_time: 00:04:13.858] [duration: 00:00:02.746] [start_time: 00:04:15.925] [speaker_1/]   [fill/]  [speaker_2/]  the appendix off. [end_time: 00:04:18.672] [duration: 00:00:01.500] [start_time: 00:04:22.699] [speaker_1/]  That's what it was t- [end_time: 00:04:24.199] [duration: 00:00:12.716] [start_time: 00:04:38.900] [speaker_1/]  So, the risk of taking out the  [m_t/] appendix when everything is  [m_t/] inflamed is that the   [m_t/] cecum that the  [m_t/] appendix is attached to can be  [m_t/] inflamed as well so if the  [m_t/] cecum is  [m_t/] inflamed [end_time: 00:04:51.616] [duration: 00:00:11.202] [start_time: 00:04:51.616] [speaker_1/]   Sometimes if you go into [m_t/]  surgery you can't cut off the appendix because the cecum is in also.  [speaker_2/]    [uni/]    [speaker_1/]  And then if they have to remove the cecum, then they have to attach, the rest of the bowel [c_o/] [end_time: 00:05:02.819] [duration: 00:00:07.029] [start_time: 00:05:02.819] [b_s/]   [speaker_1/]   The cecum is part of the bowel.  [speaker_2/]  Right, so they have to cut off the parts.  [o_s/]   [speaker_1/]   But I did not get report that they did, that they removed [end_time: 00:05:09.848] [duration: 00:00:01.576] [start_time: 00:05:16.098] [speaker_1/]   [fill/] okay [speaker_2/] okay [end_time: 00:05:17.675] [duration: 00:00:03.628] [start_time: 00:05:25.113] [speaker_1/]    [n_s/]    [speaker_2/]  It depends what comes out.   [speaker_1/]    [n_s/]    [speaker_2/]   That's not something anybody can [c_o/] [end_time: 00:05:28.741] [duration: 00:00:02.990] [start_time: 00:05:30.520] [speaker_1/] just  gotta wait   [speaker_2/] we gotta wait   [speaker_1/] yeah [speaker_2/] we gotta still give you a [end_time: 00:05:33.510] [duration: 00:00:06.321] [start_time: 00:05:37.385] [n_s/]  [speaker_1/]  So food wags we'll be looking on that.
