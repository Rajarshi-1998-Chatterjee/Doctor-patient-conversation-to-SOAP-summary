[speaker_2/]  I'm tired yeah, because I know my engine switched a little bit. I got onto a better plan that just renewed so. [speaker_1/]  Is that the guardian plan?  [speaker_2/]  Yeah but I got the buyout plan, [fill/]  the higher tier at my work, it was a, a better, I don't know how much better it is, I don't know but it's still guardian. It was just a more expensive tier on my insurance that's provided through work, so I don't know if it'll help at all but we'll see. [end_time: 00:00:28.330] [duration: 00:00:13.010] [start_time: 00:00:28.330] [speaker_1/]  [fill/] Let's find out, so [o_s/]  [speaker_2/] Because I got something in the mail something about that I think you all might have submitted a potential request for it, and I think it was denied because it showed four denials that they deemed it medically unnecessary. [end_time: 00:00:41.340] [duration: 00:00:02.796] [start_time: 00:00:41.340] [speaker_1/]   So, I forgot to bring that paper with me. [end_time: 00:00:44.137] [duration: 00:00:06.463] [start_time: 00:00:44.689] [n_s/]  [speaker_1/]  Some [o_s/]  [speaker_2/] Okay [speaker_1/] Some of them [speaker_2/] So let me see if we have a copy of that   [speaker_3/]   Yeah. [n_s/] [end_time: 00:00:51.153] [duration: 00:00:27.680] [start_time: 00:00:59.003] [speaker_1/]  That's for cleaning though   [speaker_2/]    [fill/] They didn't, they didn't  [fill/] cover  [o_s/]  [speaker_1/] Yeah  [uni/]  [speaker_2/] The deep cleaning    [speaker_1/]  Yeah they didn't cover the cleaning.   [speaker_2/] Okay, maybe it wasn't for the maybe, I thought we might have submitted a request for the extractions we talked about  [o_s/]  [speaker_1/]  I can do that as well  [o_s/]  [speaker_1/] to see if [o_s/]  [speaker_1/]  Yeah [speaker_2/] what they'll cover on there   [o_s/]  [speaker_1/]  [uni/]  [speaker_2/] Oh, so they didn't, which I already paid for the deep cleaning though.  [speaker_1/]  Yeah you're already sorted over there  [o_s/]  [speaker_2/]  Yeah, I guess we might have submitted it to see if they wou-  [o_s/]  [speaker_1/]  [uni/]  [speaker_2/] pick up any of it  [speaker_1/]  Yeah and we have resubmitted it just so you know  [speaker_2/]  Oh, okay cool   [speaker_1/] Yeah already because we are not gonna let them [end_time: 00:01:26.684] [duration: 00:00:10.217] [start_time: 00:01:26.684] [speaker_1/]  Yeah, well no I appreciate that so that's what that was for it wasn't for that they just said  the medical [fill/]  deep cleaning [speaker_2/]  yeah sure okay yeah so let me see why they said so [end_time: 00:01:36.901] [duration: 00:00:15.277] [start_time: 00:01:37.680] [speaker_1/]  If I can get that.  [speaker_2/]  Okay.  [speaker_1/]  I'm gonna have to check.  [speaker_2/]   [fill/]   [speaker_1/]   On this elsewhere, but that was for that.  [speaker_3/]  No, okay.  [speaker_2/]  Yeah.  [uni/]  [speaker_1/]   Yeah let's do.  [speaker_2/]  we understand they have to put it on the   [uni/]    [speaker_1/]   Yeah it's quite a bit of   [uni/]    [speaker_2/]  [fill/]  [uni/]  [speaker_3/]  I think it was four. [end_time: 00:01:52.958] [duration: 00:00:29.902] [start_time: 00:01:52.958] [speaker_1/]  It's two lower and two upper. [b_s/]  [speaker_2/]  Yeah. [speaker_1/] Because there's the wisdoms [speaker_2/]  Yeah, which I think we were going to focus here because of. [speaker_1/] Yeah, this is infectious disease. [speaker_2/]  the infection there was infection up top and on bottom, I'm pretty sure. [speaker_1/]   yeah. [speaker_2/]  So so what would you like me? [uni/]  [speaker_1/]   [fill/] So I know some of the sedation options we're not going to  do laughing gas i just got the results back showing I have gene mutation [b_s/] whatever. [speaker_2/]  [uni/]  [speaker_1/]  Yep yes sir [fill/] so we're not going to do the laughing gas I basically wanted to know what the other options were because I forgot. [speaker_2/] So you. [end_time: 00:02:22.860] [duration: 00:00:18.309] [start_time: 00:02:22.860] [speaker_1/]  It's just oral sedation [o_s/]  [speaker_2/] Oral sedation? [speaker_1/]  [uni/]   do you want me to come to the back with you and discuss this a little bit. [speaker_2/] Yeah yeah that'd be great because I'd like to get it done, you know,  I don't want to wait another place to talk about it again and whatnot so  hang out [end_time: 00:02:41.170] [duration: 00:00:03.636] [start_time: 00:02:41.170] [speaker_1/]  [fill/] Might as well. Do you also have [fill/] mouthwash? [end_time: 00:02:44.806] [duration: 00:00:04.181] [start_time: 00:02:46.210] [speaker_1/]  [uni/]  [speaker_2/]  My wife was asking too, so,  [speaker_1/]  [uni/] [end_time: 00:02:50.392] [duration: 00:00:30.465] [start_time: 00:03:00.672] [speaker_1/]  [fill/]  For the extractions.   [speaker_2/]   You can take it too    [speaker_3/]  So, active [m_t/]  infections    [speaker_1/]  Right    [speaker_3/]    [fill/]  [m_t/] Sedation options you have three. So, the first is  [m_t/] Nitrous, it sounds like you don't  want to do it [o_s/]   [speaker_1/]   That's the laughing gas right now  [speaker_3/]  Yeah, so it's not going to kill you  [speaker_1/]   I know, but   [speaker_3/]  It will make you pretty [m_t/]  sluggish  for the next couple of days, you're probably  going to knock out   [speaker_1/]  Yeah   [speaker_3/]  That's what M. T. H. F. R.  basically does. It's more dangerous for children than adults, children just because they're not bouncing around [end_time: 00:03:31.137] [duration: 00:00:10.479] [start_time: 00:03:31.137] [speaker_1/]  You feel like something is wrong?  [speaker_2/]  Of course.  [speaker_1/]   Right, [fill/]  so the typical offset for that I'm telling you all this. You may not want to do it, but just. [speaker_2/]  No, no, no. You're covering your bases, which I understand. [end_time: 00:03:41.616] [duration: 00:00:18.630] [start_time: 00:03:41.616] [speaker_1/]  The typical offset for that is high doses of  [m_t/] vitamin B. six and  [m_t/] B. twelve  prior to inhalation of  [m_t/] nitrous  [speaker_2/]  okay  [speaker_1/]  so you're basically saying to your body, hey let's get as much energy in now because  [speaker_2/]  [fill/]  [speaker_1/]   I know that my ability to generate energy from food or from sleep is going to be impaired for the next [end_time: 00:04:00.246] [duration: 00:00:21.296] [start_time: 00:04:00.246] [speaker_1/]  Day or two days   [speaker_2/]  Gotcha, okay. [speaker_1/]   Right  [fill/] So that's typically what people do now, the second level  after that  [m_t/] oral sedation [speaker_2/]  [fill/]  [speaker_1/]  [m_t/]  Oral sedation is a  [m_t/] pill we use  [uni/]  here  [speaker_2/]  [fill/]  [speaker_1/]  [fill/] Or  [m_t/] halcyon here it's  called in [m_t/]  generic  [speaker_2/] Okay [speaker_1/]  [fill/] Basically, that is a very very very strong [m_t/]  muscle relaxant [speaker_2/]  [fill/]  [speaker_1/]  You're basically  at the edge of sleep [end_time: 00:04:21.542] [duration: 00:00:30.273] [start_time: 00:04:21.542] [speaker_1/]  [fill/]  Think about it like you've had, if nitrous is having like one beer, you know,  [fill/] oral sedation is like having three or four or five beers.  [speaker_2/]  No, that would do it I haven't drank in over a year and a half, that'd really do man. [v_n/]  [speaker_1/]  Yeah, yeah.  [speaker_2/]  I know so I get I get your  [speaker_1/]  Yeah, so that's gonna [v_n/]  it's gonna be like you're saying funny things to the doctor,  [speaker_2/]   Yeah. [o_s/]  [uni/]    [speaker_1/]  you know they're used to it.   [speaker_2/]  It's almost like you're there, but not.   [speaker_1/]  Yeah, okay.   [speaker_2/]  You're still awake per say,   [speaker_1/]  You are technically awake, but it's it's like you're at that edge, of sleeping, [fill/] and so you'll go kind of in and out etcetera. [end_time: 00:04:51.816] [duration: 00:00:14.360] [start_time: 00:04:51.816] [speaker_1/]  [fill/] but for about two to three hours of that of within taking the pill it's gonna be like hey  [fill/]  [speaker_2/]  [fill/]  [speaker_1/] I don't really know what's going on. [speaker_2/]  Yeah   [speaker_1/]   [fill/] You will have to have a driver   [speaker_2/]  Yeah that's fine.  [speaker_1/]  and you're going to be [end_time: 00:05:06.177] [duration: 00:00:10.496] [start_time: 00:05:06.177] [speaker_1/]   It'll basically put you on your butt for about six hours or so. [speaker_2/] Okay. [speaker_1/]  So the first three is going to be like that in and out stage  the second three or four you're going to be just very sleepy   [speaker_2/] gotcha. [end_time: 00:05:16.673] [duration: 00:00:14.056] [start_time: 00:05:16.673] [speaker_1/]  Yeah.   [speaker_2/]   [fill/] So that works really well if you're doing something like, an extraction in the afternoon, [b_s/]  [speaker_2/]  or something like that because you're just going to be kind of out of it go to sleep you wake up in the next morning [speaker_3/]   I understand.  [speaker_1/]   Well you wake up in the middle of the night probably from four you're gonna have some pain. [end_time: 00:05:30.730] [duration: 00:00:11.221] [start_time: 00:05:30.730] [speaker_1/]  Yeah   [speaker_2/]  So,  [speaker_1/]   and I from what I remember y'all do that a lot more frequently just in-house here  [o_s/]  [uni/]  [speaker_1/]  Yeah.  [uni/]  [speaker_2/]   I've used sedation and someone has to come in,  [o_s/]  [uni/]  [speaker_1/] Yeah we just have to schedule you.  [speaker_2/] and got you.  [speaker_1/]  [fill/] [end_time: 00:05:41.952] [duration: 00:00:12.470] [start_time: 00:05:41.952] [speaker_1/]  So, we actually have four levels of  [speaker_3/]  sedation now, look at that  so like the third level is  [m_t/]  I. V. sedation which is which is basically using  [m_t/]  I. V. drugs to simulate that [end_time: 00:05:54.422] [duration: 00:00:14.613] [start_time: 00:05:54.422] [speaker_1/] State where you're kinda in and out of sleep. You're still technically awake, but your body's gonna be limp, et cetera. You're only gonna be responsive if we tap you [speaker_2/] Yeah [speaker_1/] something like that [uni/] [speaker_2/] what what drug is using the I. V. on that level of sedation? [speaker_1/] I don't know [end_time: 00:06:09.036] [duration: 00:00:28.316] [start_time: 00:06:09.036] [speaker_1/]  There's that's different based on  [fill/] there's the, whoever is the  [o_s/]  [m_t/] anesthesiologist most of the time.  [speaker_2/] Okay.  [speaker_1/]  I I can double check for you.  [speaker_2/] Okay.  [speaker_1/] Are you allergic to anything?  [speaker_2/] Not that I know of.  [speaker_1/]  Okay,  [o_s/] but you just want to know.  [speaker_2/]  I'm just scared.  [v_n/] Yeah, just want to know.   [speaker_1/] I can double check for you. And then the  [m_t/] fourth level sedation, now this is  [m_t/] general sedation.  [speaker_2/]  [fill/]  [speaker_1/] Right? So the same thing you would have in a hospital if you were to have arm surgery.  [speaker_2/]  [o_s/] Gotcha. [speaker_1/]  Or something like that.  [speaker_2/] Okay.  [speaker_1/] We do that with an  [m_t/] anesthesiologist, now they use a cocktail of whatever drug you know.  [speaker_2/] Yeah, that they use. [end_time: 00:06:37.352] [duration: 00:00:14.816] [start_time: 00:06:37.352] [speaker_1/]  No whatever drug that you want or that's right for your body,  [speaker_2/] Okay.  [speaker_1/] so the  [m_t/] anesthesiologist is even more in-depth  they're going to go  [speaker_2/]    they consult with me on what works  [o_s/]  [uni/]  [speaker_1/] Yeah, they prior to you,   [speaker_2/] Okay.  [speaker_1/] they're going to consult with you and talk to you about your preferences etc, now they charge like eight hundred dollars  an hour. [end_time: 00:06:52.169] [duration: 00:00:12.689] [start_time: 00:06:52.169] [speaker_1/]  for that. For five f- for the regular  [m_t/] IV sedation it's five seventy-five.  [speaker_2/]   [fill/] .  [speaker_1/]   [fill/] , no matter how long it takes.  [speaker_2/]   [fill/] . So five seventy-five flat?  [speaker_1/]  Flat.  [speaker_2/]  For the regular one. The other one's eight hundred something bucks an hour?  [speaker_1/]  An hour. [end_time: 00:07:04.859] [duration: 00:00:27.523] [start_time: 00:07:04.859] [speaker_1/]  Okay.   [speaker_2/]  It's it's eight hundred an hour [fill/]  for the first hour and then two hundred every fifteen minutes after that.  [speaker_2/]  [fill/]  [speaker_1/]   eight hundred eight hundred, right? [fill/]    [speaker_1/]  Yeah, it adds up.    [speaker_2/]  Yeah, it adds up.  [fill/]  Then the  [m_t/] oral sedation is I believe four twelve, four hundred and twelve dollars,  [speaker_2/] Okay.  [speaker_1/] That is the fee not for the  [m_t/] medication, but for the monitoring services that the doctors need to do [o_s/]    [speaker_1/]   that they're monitoring you on.   [speaker_1/]  Yeah.    [speaker_2/]  Got you.   [speaker_1/]  It's basically making sure you stay alive   [speaker_2/] Got you.  [speaker_1/]  Of course. [end_time: 00:07:32.382] [duration: 00:00:51.924] [start_time: 00:07:32.382] [speaker_1/]  [fill/]  And then s- the [m_t/]  I. V. Oh sorry, the [m_t/] nitrous is I think a hundred bucks or something like that.   [speaker_2/]  [fill/]  Cheapest option.  Yeah [uni/]  [speaker_1/]   Yeah, because it's like one beer three beers. [speaker_2/] Yeah. [speaker_1/]  You know, seven eight beers.  [speaker_2/]    Yeah, it costs more those heavier levels, and  [speaker_1/]    Yeah yeah, and at the once you go to the [m_t/] I. V. stage and the the  [speaker_2/]  General  [speaker_1/]  General sedation stage, it's really you're just paying for the cost of the [m_t/] drugs.  [speaker_2/]   [fill/] Yeah.  [speaker_1/]    because it is what it's what the same stuff they use in the hospital we use.  [speaker_2/]    [uni/]    [speaker_1/]  We use a hospital [m_t/] anesthesiologist.  [speaker_2/]  Got you.   [speaker_1/]  To come here.    [speaker_2/]  So, with my situation here would we be doing all four at once?  [speaker_1/]   Yeah, you could do oral.   [speaker_2/]  Yeah.  [speaker_1/]   I would not recommend  [m_t/] nitrous even if you weren't allergic,  that's just too much.  [speaker_2/]   So, even if we just did the the [m_t/] pill the oral,  are we going?  [speaker_1/]  Yeah.   [speaker_2/]  To get all four of these teeth out in one sitting?  [speaker_1/]   Should be able to   [speaker_2/]   Yeah   [speaker_1/]  We've done more, we've done eight before.  [speaker_2/]    I don't want to do eight but, I mean, I'm just curious  I didn't you know so   [speaker_1/]   Yeah. [speaker_2/]  [fill/] Okay. [end_time: 00:08:24.306] [duration: 00:00:20.756] [start_time: 00:08:24.306] [speaker_1/]  That basically covers it  and then as far as    [speaker_2/]  What are you going to replace it with? That's the next question because you're going to be chewing on one side for a while.  [speaker_1/]   [fill/]  Yeah, and that's that's one thing we talked about as well.  [speaker_2/]  Yeah  [speaker_1/]  Like, if we get all these out, we'd probably we would want this stuff to heal correct, you know what I mean? We'd come back and we would   [o_s/]  [speaker_2/]  Yeah, so    [speaker_1/]  is there bridge options or replacement like a  [speaker_2/]   You can do two bridges. [end_time: 00:08:45.062] [duration: 00:00:11.947] [start_time: 00:08:45.062] [speaker_1/]  Okay.   [speaker_2/]  [fill/]  That's going to be your cheapest option.  [speaker_1/]    Okay.  [speaker_2/]  Alright  so it's going to be about two K per bridge or so for the back teeth.  [fill/]  [speaker_1/]   And what are the other options like implants of some sort? [end_time: 00:08:57.010] [duration: 00:00:23.051] [start_time: 00:08:57.010] [speaker_1/]  Yeah, so you could the next option [n_s/]  I don't think you're gonna be a good candidate for a permanent bridge. That's when they shave down the front and the back tooth and then put permanent bridges or permanent teeth [fill/] there. They're not fixed to anything except the front and the back  [speaker_2/]  [fill/]  [speaker_1/]  but because you only have wisdoms left after that  [speaker_2/]  Yeah. [speaker_1/]  on the backs I don't think that would be a good option for you  [speaker_2/]  okay. [speaker_1/]   [fill/] [end_time: 00:09:20.061] [duration: 00:00:12.386] [start_time: 00:09:20.061] [speaker_1/]  It might be depending as long as there's no [m_t/]  infection on the wisdoms you might be a good candidate for that  so those are usually about three to four    [speaker_2/]  The wi- the wisdoms at some point if I needed to I would plan on getting out as well.   [speaker_1/]   Yeah, so [end_time: 00:09:32.447] [duration: 00:00:17.414] [start_time: 00:09:32.447] [speaker_1/] Yeah, exactly. So if you're going to do that, don't- the permanent bridge doesn't make sense.  [o_s/]  [speaker_2/] Yeah,  [uni/]  [speaker_1/] You're just going to be throwing away money. [speaker_2/] Exactly. Okay. [speaker_1/]  [fill/] The implants, right. So that is the  [fill/] most expensive option. Usually, it's about seventy-five dollars per tooth that you're replacing to [speaker_2/] And that would come out to four teeth, right? [end_time: 00:09:49.862] [duration: 00:00:20.739] [start_time: 00:09:49.862] [speaker_1/]  Yeah, so we're talking thirty K. right, and we can do a little bit of [fill/]   we can do a good amount of discounting on that  [speaker_2/]  yeah  [speaker_1/]    We can probably get to like twenty-five or something like that  [speaker_2/]  yeah which is still a crazy amount, but  [speaker_1/]  it's still nuts, but  [speaker_2/]   but  you're right if I don't put something back  then I'm going to be chewing all wonky  and my bite's going to get uneven and stuff  [speaker_1/]  well the way [end_time: 00:10:10.602] [duration: 00:00:15.187] [start_time: 00:10:10.602] [speaker_1/]  What I tell patients is this, right?  You've got to replace it with something and it should be replaced with something within a year.  It doesn't have to be the implant starting out. You have to sh-  [speaker_2/] Yeah.  [speaker_1/] need to replace it with something, right? So if it has to start out with bridges, you know,  [fill/]  you spend the [end_time: 00:10:25.789] [duration: 00:00:16.318] [start_time: 00:10:25.789] [speaker_1/] Three to thirty five hundred four K. or whatever it is for the bridges,  [speaker_2/]  [uni/]  [speaker_1/] Yeah, yeah so that's total. Then let's say you hang out for a little bit, you know, let the [m_t/] bone heal, let everything have  work its way up for about a year to two years or so, [speaker_2/]  [fill/] Yeah. get started on the [m_t/] implant process. [end_time: 00:10:42.107] [duration: 00:00:12.149] [start_time: 00:10:42.107] [speaker_1/]  You can do the  [m_t/]  implants one or two at a time if you wanted.  [speaker_2/]  Yeah, you could.  [speaker_1/]   Yeah, you could? Yeah,  [speaker_2/]  Well,  [speaker_1/]  looking at all options.  [speaker_2/]  Yeah. We've got to- We've gotta do it one or two at a time. And the other thing that we need to plan, in a  [m_t/]  case like this, [end_time: 00:10:54.257] [duration: 00:00:27.674] [start_time: 00:10:54.257] [speaker_1/]  Is okay, well should we do the uppers first the lowers first [speaker_2/]  [fill/]  [speaker_1/]  because you're gonna get rid of  one of those  [m_t/] bridges you know, [speaker_2/]   yeah.  [speaker_1/]   and we have to also make sure that that [m_t/]  bridge is not gonna hit  that  [m_t/] implant and it's gonna mess it up. [speaker_2/]  Yeah everything's gotta work together.  [speaker_1/]   exactly so  there's for something like this it's a lot easier when you're just missing one tooth and then there's  nothing  [speaker_2/]  [fill/]  [speaker_1/] right but for something like this it's gonna take a lot  [o_s/]  [speaker_1/] yeah. [speaker_2/] also  upper and a lower so you  gotta  make sure that they work together   [speaker_1/]  yeah .  [speaker_2/]  so it makes sense.  [speaker_1/]   yeah so it's a lot of careful  planning that we need to do. [speaker_2/]  [fill/]  [speaker_1/]  [fill/] [end_time: 00:11:21.932] [duration: 00:00:20.047] [start_time: 00:11:21.932] [speaker_1/]  But I'm confident, you know, our doctors can do it. They've done it before. [speaker_2/]  [fill/]  [n_s/]  [speaker_1/]  Now the thing about that you want to think about  is, you know, is just time frame, and then really just planning it out with the doctor, and making sure that you're okay, and your lifestyle's okay, to support it. [speaker_2/]  [fill/]  [speaker_1/]  So in this case, I would probably recommend, you know,  let's take the teeth out. [end_time: 00:11:41.980] [duration: 00:00:13.601] [start_time: 00:11:41.980] [speaker_1/]  [n_s/]  was planned for taking the teeth out   [speaker_2/]   yeah    [speaker_1/]  and then plan to come back you know about two weeks later  and we'll get you fitted up on some [m_t/]  bridges  [speaker_2/]  [fill/]  [speaker_1/]  [fill/]  and we can even  [m_t/] scan for that stuff beforehand  so  [speaker_2/]  yeah  [speaker_1/]   that you can deliver it a little bit right after that [end_time: 00:11:55.581] [duration: 00:00:12.234] [start_time: 00:11:55.581] [speaker_1/]  [fill/]   [b_s/] And then [n_s/]  after that we want to, I would just say hang hang out for probably you know a year even.  [fill/] The minimum is gonna be six months. [end_time: 00:12:07.815] [duration: 00:00:10.884] [start_time: 00:12:07.815] [speaker_1/] With the bridges [speaker_2/]  yeah the minimum is going to be six months, but you can as long as you can tolerate the bridges [speaker_1/]  yeah [speaker_2/]  right you can I would just wait just hang out [speaker_1/]  [fill/] [end_time: 00:12:18.700] [duration: 00:00:34.149] [start_time: 00:12:18.700] [speaker_1/]  Until you're ready to go through the  [m_t/] implant process because, [speaker_2/]  [fill/]  [speaker_1/]  you know, taking out a tooth, putting in a bridge that's one day.   [speaker_2/]  Yeah. [speaker_1/]  Right? The  [m_t/] implant process is seeing us a bunch for the course of, you know, six to eight months. [speaker_2/]  [fill/]  [speaker_1/]  As we get it done especially if you're going to stagger it  like top and bottom, then you're talking about like a year treatment plan.  [speaker_2/]   So, I guess a one one implant is a pretty tedious process?  [speaker_1/]   Yeah. [speaker_2/]  [uni/]  just for one. [speaker_1/]  Just one is tedious. [speaker_2/]  So, okay. [speaker_1/] So,  [speaker_2/]  So, y- y- y- you do one  at a time simply because you have to?  [speaker_1/]  No, we don't do one at a time.  [speaker_2/]   So, you could we could   [speaker_1/]  [fill/]  We do we've done four at a time before just not opposing.  [speaker_2/]  Yeah.
