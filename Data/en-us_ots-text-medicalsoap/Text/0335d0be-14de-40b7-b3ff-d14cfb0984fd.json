[speaker_2/]    [fill/]   yeah. [speaker_1/]  is that  [PERSON/]  now? [end_time: 00:00:11.110] [duration: 00:00:12.111] [start_time: 00:00:11.110] [speaker_1/]   No, your your left kidney is blocked it's obstructed  [speaker_2/]    okay [speaker_1/]  yeah [speaker_2/] with this tumor? [speaker_1/] with this tumor, yeah  [speaker_2/] so, how do you get the tumor out? [end_time: 00:00:23.222] [duration: 00:00:23.559] [start_time: 00:00:23.222] [speaker_1/]   Well, [v_n/]  [fill/] l what we need to do is to take a sample of it.  Now, I just try to relax that muscle   [speaker_2/] Oh, relax   [speaker_1/] As best you can because the more you can relax the muscle the easier this is, so you know like you do when you go pee. [end_time: 00:00:46.781] [duration: 00:00:10.805] [start_time: 00:00:46.781] [speaker_1/]  Yeah.  [speaker_2/]  Do you just relax and let the urine come out? [speaker_1/]  Yes.  [speaker_2/]  Same thing here.  [speaker_1/]  Okay.  [speaker_2/]  You want to just try to relax that muscle.  [speaker_1/]  My legs are j- let me  [speaker_2/]  And n-  [c_o/] [end_time: 00:00:57.586] [duration: 00:00:11.960] [start_time: 00:00:57.586] [speaker_1/] that allows me to be able to pass this scope into the bladder [speaker_2/] but the legs spin  [fill/]  my leg was spinning  [v_n/]  [speaker_1/] not so sure about that [end_time: 00:01:09.547] [duration: 00:00:03.991] [start_time: 00:01:09.547] [speaker_1/]  Okay, so the obstruction has been obstructed. I mean, [end_time: 00:01:13.538] [duration: 00:00:09.104] [start_time: 00:01:14.901] [speaker_1/]  My kidney is being obstructed, right?  [speaker_2/]  [fill/] , your kidney is- is blocked.

[speaker_2/]  Yes    [speaker_1/]  Yeah   [speaker_2/]  Where's that blood coming from  the   [m_t/]  tumor   [speaker_1/]   yeah    [speaker_2/]  Well wouldn't the   [m_t/]  tumor go down then    [speaker_1/]  No [end_time: 00:01:45.659] [duration: 00:00:01.489] [start_time: 00:01:45.659] [speaker_1/]  No, of course not. [end_time: 00:01:47.149] [duration: 00:00:11.656] [start_time: 00:01:49.752] [speaker_1/]  Where's the blood coming from that's in the  [m_t/] tumor?  [speaker_2/]   [fill/] The,  [v_n/] the tumor is like any   [fill/]  part of your body, any  [m_t/] tissue in your body, a  [m_t/] tumor has a blood supply. [end_time: 00:02:01.409] [duration: 00:00:03.454] [start_time: 00:02:02.872] [speaker_1/]  Oh, I see. [speaker_2/]  So, it can break and bleed. [speaker_1/]   Yeah. [end_time: 00:02:06.327] [duration: 00:00:10.838] [start_time: 00:02:07.677] [speaker_1/]   All right so  [fill/]  [v_n/] that is a  [m_t/] tumor in there that is gonna be a  [m_t/] cancer of the  [m_t/] bladder [end_time: 00:02:18.515] [duration: 00:00:03.036] [start_time: 00:02:18.515] [speaker_1/]  So it's [fill/] [end_time: 00:02:21.552] [duration: 00:00:12.507] [start_time: 00:02:24.901] [speaker_1/]   So is this the answer one of those things   [speaker_2/]   Well   [fill/]   it would be extremely unusual for it not to be the way it looks.  [speaker_3/] Yeah,  [speaker_1/] let's sit you up  yeah. [end_time: 00:02:37.408] [duration: 00:00:10.146] [start_time: 00:02:37.408] [speaker_1/] You got it. [speaker_2/] Because the other [m_t/]  chemo before almost killed me. I was in the hospital four and a half months, eight months after the  [m_t/] chemo. [o_s/]  [speaker_1/] Is that right? [speaker_2/]  [m_t/] Bone infection. [end_time: 00:02:47.554] [duration: 00:00:15.471] [start_time: 00:02:47.554] [speaker_1/]  [uni/]  on my right side. [speaker_2/] Okay. [fill/]  [speaker_3/] I'm going to get this to you. This is just about the  [uni/]  [speaker_2/] So, [fill/] wh- what [fill/] I know you you live alone. Does [fill/] does [fill/] [end_time: 00:03:03.026] [duration: 00:00:13.085] [start_time: 00:03:03.026] [speaker_1/]  Thank you  [PERSON/]  . Do you have anybody else around? Do you have family or anything that's  [speaker_2/]  No.  [speaker_1/]  Just trying to get a sense [end_time: 00:03:16.111] [duration: 00:00:02.744] [start_time: 00:03:16.111] [speaker_1/]  Because we got to make a decision. [end_time: 00:03:18.856] [duration: 00:00:11.774] [start_time: 00:03:20.205] [speaker_1/]   The this is likely going to be an  [m_t/] invasive bladder cancer that's blocking the left [m_t/] kidney  [speaker_2/]   Okay  [speaker_1/] And [fs_end/] [end_time: 00:03:31.979] [duration: 00:00:11.202] [start_time: 00:03:31.979] [speaker_1/]  [fill/]  It's not gonna be good and it's not gonna be easy to take care of it. [fill/]  It looks like a a pretty big tumor. [end_time: 00:03:43.181] [duration: 00:00:12.156] [start_time: 00:03:43.181] [speaker_1/]  So that the chance of curing you of it, even with really aggressive  [fill/] treatments.   [speaker_2/]    [fill/]    [speaker_1/]   No- not chemo, we usually use [fill/] [end_time: 00:03:55.338] [duration: 00:00:03.637] [start_time: 00:03:55.338] [speaker_1/]    [m_t/] Surgery for this, removing your whole [m_t/]  bladder. [end_time: 00:03:58.975] [duration: 00:00:01.752] [start_time: 00:04:00.701] [speaker_1/]  It's something to go through. [end_time: 00:04:02.453] [duration: 00:00:18.849] [start_time: 00:04:04.530] [speaker_1/]  and, if it's, if it's the  [m_t/] tumor is confined to the bladder then there's a chance that you could be cured from this  [m_t/] tumor. We would have to take your  bladder out and hook up your kidneys, the urethra, back up to a piece of intestine. [end_time: 00:04:23.379] [duration: 00:00:09.112] [start_time: 00:04:23.379] [speaker_1/]   And bring out the intestine to your side, into a bag where the urine would come out into a bag in your side.  [speaker_2/]   For the rest of my life?  [speaker_1/]    Yeah. [end_time: 00:04:32.492] [duration: 00:00:13.780] [start_time: 00:04:35.952] [speaker_1/]   What's the other choice?  [speaker_2/]  [fill/] There isn't one.   [speaker_1/]  Just die?    [speaker_2/]  Well yeah, but it's a rough way to go.  [speaker_1/]  Oh! so you said what would you do if it was you? [end_time: 00:04:49.733] [duration: 00:00:09.199] [start_time: 00:04:49.733] [speaker_1/] I have my bladder out for sure but I'm not seventy-nine years old and having been through other things [speaker_2/] yeah [speaker_1/] with lung problems too so [end_time: 00:04:58.932] [duration: 00:00:23.228] [start_time: 00:05:00.807] [speaker_1/]   It's not an easy thing,   [speaker_2/]   My good gosh   [speaker_1/]   I could send you to the  [m_t/] oncologist but, I I think I know what they're going to say is that with only one  [m_t/] kidney one  [m_t/] kidney is blocked the other one is is open, your overall  [m_t/] kidney function is fine but they're going to want that  [m_t/] kidney drained and then they're going to say okay you can have  [m_t/] chemotherapy [end_time: 00:05:24.036] [duration: 00:00:16.931] [start_time: 00:05:25.711] [speaker_1/] You might not do very well and the tumor is too big for the  [m_t/] chemotherapy to cure it so you would have to [speaker_2/] have just take the tumor out [speaker_1/] we can't just take the tumor out because it's too big and it involves too much it involves one third of your bladder [end_time: 00:05:42.643] [duration: 00:00:11.347] [start_time: 00:05:42.643] [speaker_1/]  So that that doesn't work for  [m_t/] bladder cancer to to when it's invaded into the [m_t/]  bladder? To just take the  [m_t/] tumor out,  it just comes right back. [end_time: 00:05:53.990] [duration: 00:00:02.788] [start_time: 00:05:53.990] [speaker_1/] So our only option is to take the whole  [m_t/] bladder out. [end_time: 00:05:56.779] [duration: 00:00:13.051] [start_time: 00:06:00.685] [speaker_1/]  Why is it something to go through?   [speaker_2/]  It takes about five to six hours to do the  [m_t/] surgery,  [speaker_1/]    [fill/]    [speaker_2/]   and end up being in the  [m_t/] hospital,  [speaker_1/]    [fill/]    [speaker_2/]   for a few days, and the pro- potential problems [end_time: 00:06:13.737] [duration: 00:00:05.113] [start_time: 00:06:13.737] [speaker_1/] Are significant. Over ten percent of people don't survive. [end_time: 00:06:18.850] [duration: 00:00:12.463] [start_time: 00:06:20.122] [speaker_1/]  We're really good at it, but    [speaker_2/]   Do you have any other good news?   [speaker_3/]  [v_n/]  [speaker_1/]     [fill/]    [fill/]    [speaker_3/] There's no good news, I mean no   [fill/]    [speaker_1/]   [o_s/] my goodness  [uni/]   [speaker_3/] no  [fill/] [end_time: 00:06:32.586] [duration: 00:00:13.525] [start_time: 00:06:32.586] [speaker_1/]  What we are trying to say  [PERSON/]  [speaker_2/]  So you are asking if   [fill/] she lived alone? Is that because   [fill/] after the  [m_t/] procedure, she would need a lot of assistance? [end_time: 00:06:46.111] [duration: 00:00:10.321] [start_time: 00:06:46.111] [speaker_1/]     [fill/]   No. I I've just been through this a lot, and I know that when we talk about it, and then, there's a there's a family that's gonna want to- [end_time: 00:06:56.432] [duration: 00:00:05.150] [start_time: 00:06:56.432] [speaker_1/] Help with this decision. So if there is, that's why I wanted to know. [end_time: 00:07:01.583] [duration: 00:00:02.999] [start_time: 00:07:06.872] [speaker_1/]   Well, I got a son and daughter here. [end_time: 00:07:09.872] [duration: 00:00:11.370] [start_time: 00:07:11.404] [speaker_1/] Okay.  [speaker_2/]   My son he is- he loves me dearly but he- he gets so scared of any of this he's not able to even come near me. [end_time: 00:07:22.774] [duration: 00:00:09.315] [start_time: 00:07:22.774] [speaker_1/]   You know if I get real sick and my daughter right now is angry with me.  [speaker_2/]    [fill/]    [speaker_1/]   But th- this might make a difference, you know? [end_time: 00:07:32.090] [duration: 00:00:11.988] [start_time: 00:07:33.747] [speaker_1/]  Yeah, the reason I mention it is because I always like to have as many family members come to these appointments as possible, because it's complicated and [end_time: 00:07:45.736] [duration: 00:00:14.072] [start_time: 00:07:45.736] [speaker_1/] You know hard decisions need to be made and and sometimes your family can help you. [speaker_2/]  Okay and who does the  [m_t/] surgery? [speaker_1/]  [fill/] I I do it with another  [m_t/] urologist doctor.  [speaker_2/]  [uni/] [end_time: 00:07:59.808] [duration: 00:00:04.837] [start_time: 00:07:59.808] [speaker_1/]  No. Yeah we do it together.   [speaker_2/]  But there isn't any [fill/] [end_time: 00:08:04.646] [duration: 00:00:10.629] [start_time: 00:08:06.214] [speaker_1/]   [uni/]  [speaker_2/]  [v_n/]  [speaker_1/]  proves I me- I mean, any, possibility that this could all work out.    [speaker_3/] No, that's not true. There is a possibility. [end_time: 00:08:16.844] [duration: 00:00:18.954] [start_time: 00:08:16.844] [speaker_1/]    [uni/]   worked out.   [speaker_2/]  Okay. [speaker_1/]  Yeah.  [speaker_3/]  So, ninety percent of people survived the  [m_t/] surgery.   [speaker_2/]  Okay.  [speaker_3/]  Fifty percent of those people,  [fill/] in all, all takers, we don't know exactly what we're going to find in there, but fifty percent of people who have the  [m_t/] surgery and survive it, do well  [uni/] [end_time: 00:08:35.798] [duration: 00:00:12.431] [start_time: 00:08:35.798] [speaker_1/]  [uni/]  [speaker_2/]   they may need some [m_t/]  chemotherapy, but the but it may cure you. Right now the [m_t/]  chemotherapy is not gonna cure you because this is there's too much  [m_t/] tumor [speaker_3/] So it has to be removed. Yeah. [end_time: 00:08:48.229] [duration: 00:00:10.714] [start_time: 00:08:48.229] [speaker_1/]   [o_s/]  [uni/] The  [m_t/] bladder would have to come out, and then what happens? You never have a  [m_t/] bladder again?  [speaker_2/]   [fill/] Nope. You wear a bag on the outside, and the urine just drains into the bag. [end_time: 00:08:58.944] [duration: 00:00:12.198] [start_time: 00:09:02.173] [speaker_1/]  and people survive with that?   [speaker_2/]   Yeah.   [speaker_1/]   and they do well?    [speaker_2/]  Yeah!  Yeah, I've done it in twenty-year-olds, and I've done it in eighty-year-olds, so   [speaker_1/]   Really?   [speaker_2/]  Yeah! [end_time: 00:09:14.372] [duration: 00:00:12.207] [start_time: 00:09:14.372] [speaker_1/]   Yeah.   [speaker_2/]   Okay, so what's the next step now? [speaker_1/]   If- if you wanna go forward what we would do is- is plan a surgery downstairs where we go in, and take a  [m_t/] biopsy, because we have to confirm [end_time: 00:09:26.579] [duration: 00:00:12.150] [start_time: 00:09:26.579] [speaker_1/]  That it is.  [speaker_2/]  Oh, you I thought you just took something.  [speaker_1/]  No.  [speaker_2/]  Do I have to go through that again right now?  [speaker_1/]  No. We'd have to take you downstairs. I can't do a  [m_t/] biopsy with you awake.  [speaker_2/]  Oh I see.  [speaker_1/]  Yeah,   [o_s/]    [speaker_2/]  Oh, okay.  [speaker_1/]  you'd have to be asleep. [end_time: 00:09:38.729] [duration: 00:00:11.648] [start_time: 00:09:38.729] [speaker_1/] so I do that as an outpatient down in the surgery center where we plan on going in there and taking samples of this, to show what type of tumor it is and that helps us [end_time: 00:09:50.377] [duration: 00:00:10.999] [start_time: 00:09:50.377] [speaker_1/]  To.  [speaker_2/] What stage  [m_t/] cancer?   [speaker_2/]  Well based on what we see on the C. T. we already know what the stage is, we just don't know what the tissue diagnosis is  [speaker_1/]   [fill/] [end_time: 00:10:01.376] [duration: 00:00:11.241] [start_time: 00:10:01.376] [speaker_1/]  Yeah.  [speaker_2/]    [fill/]  When would we do that?  [speaker_1/]  We'd have to find you a spot down there we we would find one today. We would find one today we would f-  [c_o/] [end_time: 00:10:12.618] [duration: 00:00:12.170] [start_time: 00:10:12.618] [speaker_1/]   Not do it today but we'd find a spot today, to do that at down at the [m_t/]  surgery center and then  because I know that having your  [m_t/] bladder out is the next step, [end_time: 00:10:24.788] [duration: 00:00:13.164] [start_time: 00:10:24.788] [speaker_1/]   We would end our schedule,  we do so much of this kind of  [m_t/] surgery  that our schedule is booked out pretty far,  we do want to find you a spot for that as well, if you're comfortable [speaker_2/] Yeah, [speaker_1/]  planning that. [speaker_2/]  we talked to them. [end_time: 00:10:37.953] [duration: 00:00:02.294] [start_time: 00:10:37.953] [speaker_1/]   [LOCATION/] in  [LOCATION/] [end_time: 00:10:40.247] [duration: 00:00:11.060] [start_time: 00:10:42.352] [speaker_1/]  So what kind of time frame are you expecting her to make a decision in? What's realistic?   [speaker_2/]  Everybody's different but  [speaker_1/]  [v_n/]  [speaker_2/]  well, I just think [end_time: 00:10:53.412] [duration: 00:00:02.232] [start_time: 00:10:53.412] [speaker_1/]  We have to do what we have to do.  [speaker_2/]  Yeah. [end_time: 00:10:55.645] [duration: 00:00:00.900] [start_time: 00:10:57.075] [speaker_1/]  Hello [end_time: 00:10:57.975] [duration: 00:00:02.092] [start_time: 00:10:59.650] [speaker_1/]  That's the right approach. [end_time: 00:11:01.743] [duration: 00:00:15.523] [start_time: 00:11:03.989] [speaker_1/]   So  [fill/] , so now you're going to let me know when  [o_s/]  [speaker_2/] Yeah, we get- [speaker_1/]   you're putting it over. [speaker_2/] Yeah, we'll get that's, we'll get those things scheduled and then  [fill/] and yeah, [uni/]  [o_s/]  [speaker_1/] But I will , you'll let me know after I get home  [speaker_2/] No, we'll do it right now while you're here. [speaker_1/]  [fill/] ,okay. [speaker_2/] Yeah. [c_o/] [end_time: 00:11:19.512] [duration: 00:00:13.989] [start_time: 00:11:19.512] [speaker_1/] o ahead and get dressed. I'm going to send my nurses back in, okay?  [speaker_2/]  So, after after she would have the surgery, she would need to have twenty-four-hour care, or what would she need to have at home? [end_time: 00:11:33.501] [duration: 00:00:11.572] [start_time: 00:11:33.501] [speaker_1/]    [fill/]   People don't typically need twenty-four hour care  [speaker_2/]  Okay [speaker_1/]   So but everybody's a little bit different   [speaker_2/] whatever she's most comfortable with  [o_s/]  [speaker_1/]  Yeah yeah  okay  so yeah. [end_time: 00:11:45.073] [duration: 00:00:10.932] [start_time: 00:11:45.073] [speaker_1/]  Yeah.  [speaker_2/] So it's not- probably like you do when you have a  [m_t/] hysterectomy you have to have  twenty-four hour care right afterwards. [speaker_1/]  You do? [speaker_2/] I guess not I guess I don't. [end_time: 00:11:56.006] [duration: 00:00:16.228] [start_time: 00:11:57.951] [speaker_1/]    [fill/]  it's just when I had the  [m_t/] bone infection i couldn't walk  well that'd be different  [speaker_2/]   Yeah  you'll be able to walk after this one   [speaker_1/]  Yeah    [speaker_2/]  Okay let's get some things arranged  I'll go ahead and get dressed  I'll send my nurses in in just a minute  thank you  [speaker_1/]    thank you [end_time: 00:12:14.179]","language":"en","category":"URO","result":{"correct_soap_O":"No objective data is available in transcript.\n\nImaging:\nCT scans showed large bladder tumor.​​​","correct_soap_P":"Based on the review of CT scans, it is seemed to be likely invasive bladder cancer obstructing left kidney.
