[end_time: 00:10:50.714] [duration: 00:00:10.158] [start_time: 00:10:50.714] [speaker_1/] The [fill/] thing is we don't know truly to this day why kids get  [m_t/] scoliosis. [speaker_2/] Okay. [speaker_1/] We have no idea. [speaker_2/] Okay. [speaker_1/] We thought we have all these theories but [end_time: 00:11:00.872] [duration: 00:00:11.133] [start_time: 00:11:00.872] [speaker_1/]   no concrete  we each time as we learn more we figure out that those theories aren't right  okay  so we just don't know that [end_time: 00:11:12.006] [duration: 00:00:22.845] [start_time: 00:11:15.034] [speaker_1/]  We just don't know what causes it  that's the thing about it  you can swing her around   [PERSON/]  so I don't have to sit here  the thing about this with kids is that when we see these curves we don't want them to progress  because she has basically a normal alignment and everything looks good  when she's here if you look here if I go up here everything is perfect [end_time: 00:11:37.879] [duration: 00:00:12.774] [start_time: 00:11:37.879] [speaker_1/]  Right on top of each other  yeah  that's kind of what this does over time  your body adapts to it over time  and it tries to keep you up straight  like if you get a curve your body makes a curve [end_time: 00:11:50.654] [duration: 00:00:10.766] [start_time: 00:11:50.654] [speaker_1/]  More to the other side too exactly   [speaker_2/]  okay yeah and one's called compensatory curve and you have both your curves are pretty  close to each other so that one curve is is  compensatory. [end_time: 00:12:01.420] [duration: 00:00:11.036] [start_time: 00:12:01.420] [speaker_1/] Developing the other one is just adapting to [uni/] So, the bigger curve is usually the one that is the main curve [speaker_2/] Okay. [speaker_1/] and the other one is what we call a compensatory curve. [end_time: 00:12:12.456] [duration: 00:00:11.306] [start_time: 00:12:12.456] [speaker_1/]  So what we need to do is most likely we need to get her into a brace  okay that's what i talked about before too actually i said maybe okay  don't  okay i know [end_time: 00:12:23.762] [duration: 00:00:03.168] [start_time: 00:12:23.762] [n_s/]   [speaker_1/]  those scary words  i know  i know  sweetheart [end_time: 00:12:26.931] [duration: 00:00:12.061] [start_time: 00:12:29.048] [speaker_1/] well honey here's the thing you know what a brace  okay i will tell you it's in a socket first because what  that means that if it helps you don't need to do the other scary words true  yeah [end_time: 00:12:41.110] [duration: 00:00:11.542] [start_time: 00:12:41.110] [speaker_1/]  But let me tell you something  I'll tell you something about the kids with the braces  you know what they do   [speaker_2/] what   [speaker_1/] they get in contests to see how pretty  [speaker_2/]  [v_n/] they  can make their brace [end_time: 00:12:52.652] [duration: 00:00:22.291] [start_time: 00:12:52.652] [speaker_1/]  okay  [speaker_2/]   so now you can have it so now you have it maybe i can have a thing right  we got how much glitter can you get in the doctor's office exactly that's the kind of  things that we run into okay so the more glitter the better it is there's some interesting  things that they come in here with and show me and they show them off very very nicely okay [end_time: 00:13:14.944] [duration: 00:00:14.866] [start_time: 00:13:14.944] [speaker_1/]  So if you have extra [uni/]  goes down. The dog's gonna have to be here, stay like five days a week extra, used to clean up the office. [speaker_2/]  [v_n/]  [speaker_3/]  Can I take it off when I go swimming? [speaker_2/]  Yes, yes, you can take it off. The thing is is that the brace does the best  the longer you wear it. [end_time: 00:13:29.811] [duration: 00:00:20.435] [start_time: 00:13:29.811] [speaker_1/]  So we like people to try and wear it most of the day  okay now the thing that we're trying to prevent is the curve from getting worse and then needing a surgery  so we like people to wear it at least ten hours a day  what we found is that if you wear it two hours a day yeah it helps but it doesn't . [end_time: 00:13:50.247] [duration: 00:00:15.204] [start_time: 00:13:50.247] [speaker_1/]  [uni/] It doesn't maximize the [speaker_2/] Exactly it doesn't do it as well as the ten hours a day [speaker_2/] Okay [speaker_1/] Okay? So those are the things that we need to do and go ahead and get you lined up with a bracing company and get you into a brace. Then what we do is I will monitor it. [end_time: 00:14:05.451] [duration: 00:00:03.359] [start_time: 00:14:05.451] [speaker_1/] to see how you do with it over time [end_time: 00:14:08.810] [duration: 00:00:02.499] [start_time: 00:14:10.031] [speaker_1/]  if it's staying the same or getting better [end_time: 00:14:12.530] [duration: 00:00:02.958] [start_time: 00:14:12.911] [speaker_1/]  we don't do anything if it has a quick drop [end_time: 00:14:15.870] [duration: 00:00:03.319] [start_time: 00:14:15.871] [speaker_1/] or it gets worse very quickly then we [end_time: 00:14:19.190] [duration: 00:00:03.899] [start_time: 00:14:20.031] [n_s/]   [speaker_1/]  Move on with fixing it but the goal is to see what we can do to [end_time: 00:14:23.930] [duration: 00:00:03.658] [start_time: 00:14:23.931] [speaker_1/] keep you out of the operating room and just get you a pretty brace [end_time: 00:14:27.590] [duration: 00:00:04.499] [start_time: 00:14:28.391] [speaker_1/] Now you have to show me the things that you do to make it look pretty okay [end_time: 00:14:32.890] [duration: 00:00:03.978] [start_time: 00:14:32.891] [speaker_1/] you are putting [person/] in a dangerous situation because she is creative [end_time: 00:14:36.870] [duration: 00:00:01.419] [start_time: 00:14:38.231] [speaker_1/]  and dark humor [end_time: 00:14:39.650] [duration: 00:00:02.919] [start_time: 00:14:41.111] [speaker_1/]  well that's good because  [fill/] like I  said people [end_time: 00:14:44.030] [duration: 00:00:04.818] [start_time: 00:14:44.031] [speaker_1/]  get  [fill/] very creative with their braces   [speaker_2/]  how long do they normally stay in braces [end_time: 00:14:48.850] [duration: 00:00:04.438] [start_time: 00:14:49.311] [speaker_1/] we usually try and have them in a brace until they get out of their growth phase [end_time: 00:14:53.750] [duration: 00:00:00.219] [start_time: 00:14:53.831] [speaker_1/] Okay. [end_time: 00:14:54.050] [duration: 00:00:10.597] [start_time: 00:14:55.165] [speaker_1/]  and you still have a growth phase to go through  usually once and that's the thing is  and that's why i was asking  [speaker_2/] the question is  is when if she had started having her period or not . [end_time: 00:15:05.762] [duration: 00:00:12.825] [start_time: 00:15:05.762] [speaker_1/] You see when they start their period, they usually that's when their growth is gonna slow down?
