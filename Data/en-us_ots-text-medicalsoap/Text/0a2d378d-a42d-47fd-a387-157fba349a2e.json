Angiogram  [speaker_2/]   Just  [m_t/] C. T. Scan   [speaker_1/]   [m_t/]  C. T. Scan okay, so you know you had the vision problem [end_time: 00:00:14.301] [duration: 00:00:12.861] [start_time: 00:00:14.301] [speaker_1/] You, how is it looking right now?  Look at my, look at my  nose.  [speaker_2/] Yes .  [speaker_1/] Tell me which hand moves.  [speaker_2/]  [uni/] you're moving your fingers on both sides.  [speaker_1/] Good, good, good,  can you see my hand moving?  [speaker_2/] Yes, yes. [end_time: 00:00:27.163] [duration: 00:00:06.834] [start_time: 00:00:27.163] [speaker_1/]    [n_s/] Excellent good  [fill/]  close your eyes  where am I touching you? [speaker_2/]   [fill/]  on this leg- [end_time: 00:00:33.997] [duration: 00:00:14.607] [start_time: 00:00:38.744] [speaker_1/]    [uni/]    [speaker_2/]  [n_n/]  Good. I mean sir- I mean looks like you had a stroke. But so you're in some ways lucky because you know, most of us were right-handed, most of our information is on the left side of the brain. [end_time: 00:00:53.351] [duration: 00:00:11.265] [start_time: 00:00:53.351] [speaker_1/]   So, you know and then the language is in the  [m_t/] left parietal region,  art stuff is on the  [m_t/] right parietal region you know  so  [fill/] and you know and sometimes people get [end_time: 00:01:04.617] [duration: 00:00:12.814] [start_time: 00:01:04.617] [speaker_1/]   a  [m_t/] stroke in your area. You know with the right  [m_t/] parieto-occipital region, it can affect the left side vision, but also it can make people neglect the the the left side of the body. [speaker_2/]  [fill/]  [speaker_1/]   You know. [end_time: 00:01:17.431] [duration: 00:00:21.794] [start_time: 00:01:17.431] [speaker_1/]   but other than that it's fairly let's just say you're lucky that it was on that side and not the other one because that would have language that people have trouble speaking.  [speaker_2/]   [fill/]   [speaker_1/]   But, you know so it's good you're doing well from your  [m_t/] stroke, okay,  but you had a  [m_t/] stroke so every time somebody has a  [m_t/] stroke we make sure that the arteries here are clear that there's no clot that can go up and cause more  [m_t/] strokes [end_time: 00:01:39.226] [duration: 00:00:12.081] [start_time: 00:01:39.226] [speaker_1/] We look at the echo, make sure there's no clots in your heart. Okay? And then we could put people on an [m_t/]  aspirin. Okay, are you not on any blood medications? [speaker_2/] No. [speaker_1/] Okay, I'm gonna put you on a [m_t/]  baby aspirin. [end_time: 00:01:51.307] [duration: 00:00:18.604] [start_time: 00:01:51.307] [speaker_1/] I'm gonna put you on a cholesterol medication. Again, I'm gonna  [fill/] you know we're gonna get those tests done and then [fill/] you have high blood pressure? [speaker_2/] Well, that's one of the the the that the doctor recommended   [speaker_1/]  [o_s/]  then then   [speaker_2/]  and I monitor in the morning and then in the afternoon [speaker_1/]  Yes  so you know when we did big studies we saw that if [end_time: 00:02:09.912] [duration: 00:00:12.803] [start_time: 00:02:09.912] [speaker_1/]   People have a  [m_t/] stroke or a  [uni/] you know.  You had a  [m_t/] stroke. [fill/]  when we maybe- make sure there's no  [m_t/] clots in your heart and neck. okay? And then if you put you on the  right  [m_t/] medications, you eat well, you exercise [end_time: 00:02:22.715] [duration: 00:00:18.690] [start_time: 00:02:22.715] [speaker_1/]  You take your medications, that reduces the risk of you having another [m_t/]  stroke by ninety percent,  okay ?So that's what we're going to do okay sounds like a plan? [speaker_2/]  yeah  [speaker_3/] all right the medication that  you're talking about um is that different than the step that she was talking about earlier or?    [speaker_1/]  No, this is  [m_t/] statin  [speaker_3/]   That is the  [m_t/] statin, okay  [speaker_1/]  Yeah  [m_t/] statin and asprin. [end_time: 00:02:41.406] [duration: 00:00:10.976] [start_time: 00:02:41.406] [speaker_1/]   and then the  [m_t/] cholesterol the blood pressure medications okay   [speaker_2/]  and what are the blood pressure medications    [speaker_1/]  the ones the primary care is giving you.  [speaker_2/]   He's not giving him any medications.   [speaker_1/]  Then don't worry about it  okay. [end_time: 00:02:52.382] [duration: 00:00:12.162] [start_time: 00:02:52.382] [speaker_1/]  then don't. Okay,  [speaker_2/]  [fill/]  [speaker_1/] I mean, you know,  the thing is that we'll see why you have this, okay? Make sure there's no reason  for this to happen again, okay?  [speaker_2/]  [fill/]  [speaker_1/] Now I know I heard that you're having some slow heart rate. [end_time: 00:03:04.544] [duration: 00:00:12.503] [start_time: 00:03:04.544] [speaker_1/]   You know, if everything looks clear, and you, you, you, you know,  you have another one  [LOCATION/] here. We, you know, because I'm gonna give you the  [m_t/] aspirin, so hopefully that will keep your  [m_t/] blood thin and no little [m_t/]  clots will form. [end_time: 00:03:17.048] [duration: 00:00:17.236] [start_time: 00:03:17.048] [speaker_1/]  [fill/]  [speaker_2/]  Okay, but if god forbid something happens then, we might do a deeper study a deeper dive, and make sure that you know, you don't have abnormal [m_t/] heart rhythms, while you're sleeping or something like that, okay? [speaker_2/] okay [speaker_1/]  All right, so we'll do that  all right anything else in [uni/] ask you so  [speaker_2/]  What is that, is, what do you mean what are we going to do? [speaker_1/]  For now, we just do a stroke workup [end_time: 00:03:34.285] [duration: 00:00:17.211] [start_time: 00:03:34.285] [speaker_1/]   okay   [speaker_2/]  okay a basic  [m_t/] stroke walk   [speaker_1/]  and what is that gonna entail?  [speaker_2/]   I told you   [m_t/] echocar- echocardiogram [m_t/] , carotid duplex, or a [m_t/]  C. T.  angiogram just to look at the [uni/]  inside the head  and the neck  [speaker_1/]  okay is that something you guys do or we go to the cardiologist    [speaker_2/]  I'll order it I'll order it.  [speaker_1/] okay [speaker_2/]  It's done at it can be done at a radiology center [end_time: 00:03:51.497] [duration: 00:00:15.961] [start_time: 00:03:51.497] [speaker_1/]  [n_n/]  The  [m_t/] cardiologist do echoes but, you know, you can get them done elsewhere as well.  [speaker_2/]   Okay. [speaker_1/]   Okay, whatever you-  [uni/]  your preference. Okay?  [speaker_2/]   Okay.    [speaker_1/]  And then you bring the results to me, we'll make sure that's clear, there's nothing to  worry about ,there's nothing to do. [speaker_2/]   Okay.  [speaker_1/]   Okay, and then  [fill/]  take the medication we give you, and [end_time: 00:04:07.458] [duration: 00:00:11.505] [start_time: 00:04:07.458] [n_s/]  [speaker_1/]   if you don't have any more episodes you're doing good,  and I'm hoping that we're on the right track    [speaker_2/]  okay, is there anything else that's included?  or just the Echocardiogram or..  [speaker_1/]  no echo carotid.  [speaker_2/] carotid? Okay. [speaker_2/]  and I n- [c_o/] [end_time: 00:04:18.964] [duration: 00:00:10.616] [start_time: 00:04:20.747] [speaker_1/] we can. Do the snore? [speaker_2/] He does. [speaker_3/]  [o_s/] Apparently so. Yes. [speaker_1/] Then we will do a sleep study. Okay? Because one of the things that new studies show that if you [end_time: 00:04:31.363] [duration: 00:00:10.897] [start_time: 00:04:31.363] [n_s/]   [speaker_1/]   Have  [m_t/] sleep apnea and it's not treated, it increases the risk of having a  [m_t/] stroke by itself.   [speaker_2/]   Okay.   [speaker_1/]   Okay?  So we'll make sure that you know and then we'll that way we'll also have take a look  at your  [m_t/] heart rate when you are sleeping. [end_time: 00:04:42.261] [duration: 00:00:13.869] [start_time: 00:04:42.261] [speaker_1/]    [n_n/]  [n_s/] Make sure you know there's nothing to get back, okay.   [speaker_2/]  Okay are these things that  we can get done like is this in the next few days this week or  [speaker_1/]   No, so i mean I'll  order it I'll order the  [m_t/] C. T. Angiogram and the  [m_t/] echo card it now. [end_time: 00:04:56.130] [duration: 00:00:12.432] [start_time: 00:04:56.130] [speaker_1/]  Okay [speaker_2/]  Okay , I don't do it myself  so whoever I send the order to they'll get it verified by the insurance company  they'll call you they'll do it  they'll send me the report  [speaker_1/] Okay [speaker_2/] Okay [speaker_1/]    Yeah I'm just trying to ask because I don't [end_time: 00:05:08.562] [duration: 00:00:12.652] [start_time: 00:05:08.562] [speaker_1/]  Neither my brother or I [fill/]   he lives by himself here [n_s/]  and  we both live [o_s/]  [speaker_2/]   [uni/] out of town I'm here all week so I was trying to help him out while   [o_s/]    [speaker_2/]  [uni/]  Yeah, this is what I would do if you feel like, hey! look I need to get this stuff done [speaker_1/]  [fill/]  [speaker_2/]   you can go to the [m_t/]  E. R. [end_time: 00:05:21.215] [duration: 00:00:11.639] [start_time: 00:05:21.215] [speaker_1/]   Okay see my dad had a  [m_t/] stroke the M. R. I.  showed this and need to be admitted  and it's not inappropriate,  they will admit you, get all this stuff done in a day or two and then get you back home,  that's something that we do very regularly as well. [end_time: 00:05:32.855] [duration: 00:00:11.950] [start_time: 00:05:32.855] [n_s/]   [speaker_1/]  In your case it might be a good idea.  [speaker_2/]  Okay.  [speaker_1/]   If you're open to going to the hospital.  [speaker_2/]  We can think about that.  [o_s/]  [speaker_3/]  Yeah. [uni/]  [speaker_2/]  We can talk to your brother.  [uni/]  [speaker_1/]  Yeah, okay. Yeah. If that happens go to the  [m_t/]  E. R.  have the doctor call me. [end_time: 00:05:44.806] [duration: 00:00:13.611] [start_time: 00:05:44.806] [speaker_1/]  And I'll explain it to them.   [speaker_2/]  Okay   [speaker_1/]  Okay?  And there there that's mostly, these things are mostly done in the  [m_t/] hospital. I only do them as an  [m_t/] outpatient when  [m_t/] patients don't want to go to the  [m_t/] hospital. [speaker_2/]  [fill/]  [speaker_1/]  Okay, because it's probably even smarter to get this done quickly. [speaker_2/]  [fill/] [end_time: 00:05:58.417] [duration: 00:00:11.701] [start_time: 00:05:58.417] [speaker_1/]   Okay?   [speaker_2/]  Okay   [speaker_3/]  Okay.   [speaker_1/]  Otherwise you stay with the  [m_t/] medication that you recommend and   [uni/]    [speaker_2/]   Yeah, give the same  [m_t/] medications.   [speaker_1/]  Okay.

[speaker_1/]  There's imaging places like like how you guys got your imaging done here at professional  [m_t/] radiology.  [speaker_2/]   [fill/] .  [speaker_1/]   [fill/] [end_time: 00:07:50.812] [duration: 00:00:10.273] [start_time: 00:07:50.812] [speaker_1/]  You can even call them  [speaker_2/] Yeah.

[speaker_1/]   usually wiser.  [o_s/]  [speaker_2/]   Is is is that the one, [fill/]  [speaker_2/]  Yeah  [speaker_1/]  I live on the on the on the  [LOCATION/]  Okay, so I want the one   [o_s/]  [speaker_1/]   This one  [speaker_2/]  that is [speaker_1/]  [fill/] [end_time: 00:08:55.961] [duration: 00:00:07.996] [start_time: 00:08:55.961] [speaker_1/]    [uni/]    [speaker_2/]  Yes and then you can call them and see if they offer those those studies  [speaker_1/] Yes.
