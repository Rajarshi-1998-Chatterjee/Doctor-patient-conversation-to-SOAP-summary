[speaker_2/]  Okay. [speaker_1/]  [fill/]  Whatever was going on with the [end_time: 00:12:02.067] [duration: 00:00:06.043] [start_time: 00:12:02.067] [speaker_1/]   Right side of the  [m_t/] heart, the feeling the pressures in the heart eventually rose to the point where you created a  [m_t/] shunt that  [uni/] [end_time: 00:12:08.111] [duration: 00:00:01.663] [start_time: 00:12:08.110] [speaker_1/]  Just that he needed oxygen. [end_time: 00:12:09.774] [duration: 00:00:01.950] [start_time: 00:12:09.775] [speaker_1/]  I-I-I suspect a- [c_o/] [end_time: 00:12:11.725] [duration: 00:00:02.781] [start_time: 00:12:11.725] [speaker_1/]  and [fill/]  [fill/] [end_time: 00:12:14.506] [duration: 00:00:11.857] [start_time: 00:12:14.507] [speaker_1/]  That's that's the shunt that we've been discussing  and [speaker_2/] right [speaker_1/]  so he's almost [uni/]  [fill/]  certainly always [fill/]  had that since birth [end_time: 00:12:26.365] [duration: 00:00:11.802] [start_time: 00:12:26.365] [speaker_1/]  I think that it is become a problem because of pressures on the right side of the heart are high . [speaker_2/]  So did that change in altitude last year might have accelerated [end_time: 00:12:38.168] [duration: 00:00:10.203] [start_time: 00:12:38.168] [speaker_1/]  or it may not have  [speaker_2/]  No, I don't think accelerated underlying disease process [speaker_1/] okay [speaker_2/]   I think it was symptomatic because of altitude,  [fill/] so oxygen levels are lower. [end_time: 00:12:48.371] [duration: 00:00:11.143] [start_time: 00:12:48.371] [speaker_1/]   Something called  [m_t/] pulmonary vasoconstriction so that the vessels in the lungs constricted it might've shunted more blood actually  right to left  [fill/]   in the heart, but  [fill/] [end_time: 00:12:59.515] [duration: 00:00:02.736] [start_time: 00:12:59.515] [speaker_1/] Other than that I don't think that the answer did any ha- [c_o/] [end_time: 00:13:02.252] [duration: 00:00:02.317] [start_time: 00:13:02.251] [speaker_1/]   Yeah, okay.

[speaker_2/]  Again just observation  [speaker_3/]   it would have been transient and when he went he went back to- it would have been back to back to where it was before   [speaker_2/]  Yeah.  [speaker_3/]   But the underlying  [m_t/] disease process was [end_time: 00:13:13.004] [duration: 00:00:01.634] [start_time: 00:13:13.004] [speaker_1/]  Simultaneously [end_time: 00:13:14.638] [duration: 00:00:02.454] [start_time: 00:13:14.638] [speaker_1/]   Do you attach any significant?

[speaker_2/] During the procedure. [speaker_1/]  Yo you you were mostly in the mid eighties during the procedure. [speaker_2/]  Say again. [speaker_1/]  You're in the mid eighties [end_time: 00:13:41.571] [duration: 00:00:01.578] [start_time: 00:13:41.571] [speaker_1/]  [uni/] the procedure. [end_time: 00:13:43.149] [duration: 00:00:07.703] [start_time: 00:13:43.150] [speaker_1/]  It is   [fill/]  we needed we needed a heavy off oxygen for the procedure because oxygen messes up all the calculations.

Question is, what are the negative consequence [end_time: 00:14:31.125] [duration: 00:00:05.914] [start_time: 00:14:31.125] [speaker_1/]  [uni/]  And how substantial are they, and that  [uni/]  so [end_time: 00:14:37.039] [duration: 00:00:06.330] [start_time: 00:14:37.040] [speaker_1/]  but anyway so the [fill/]  your  [m_t/] oxygen levels in the  [m_t/] CATH lab were somewhat low but [end_time: 00:14:43.370] [duration: 00:00:06.345] [start_time: 00:14:43.370] [speaker_1/]  Again translate it, so to do the assessment. Yeah. [end_time: 00:14:49.715] [duration: 00:00:01.964] [start_time: 00:14:49.715] [speaker_1/] So how did we pull it back?
