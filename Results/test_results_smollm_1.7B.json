I've been having headaches lately.\nDoctor: I see. Are you experiencing any visual changes, chest pain, dyspnea, or other neurological symptoms?\nPatient: No, just the headaches.\nDoctor: Alright. I understand that your previous in vitro fertilization pregnancy was complicated by preeclampsia at 27 weeks of gestation, and you delivered a growth-restricted fetus by cesarean section at 36 weeks, weighing 1900 g. Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's correct.\nDoctor: I also see in your file that you have a past history of infrarenal aortic stenosis, which was diagnosed based on a computed tomographic angiogram. This angiogram was done to investigate your persistent hypertension and intermittent claudication postpartum. It showed 75% stenosis of the infrarenal aorta with hypertrophied internal mammary and epigastric arteries. Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's right.\nDoctor: It seems that your regular medications include aspirin 100 mg and calcium 1.2 g daily. Additionally, your family history is significant for paternal ischemic heart disease and maternal hypertension. Is that accurate?\nPatient: Yes, you've got it right.\nDoctor: During your pregnancy, laboratory investigations for preeclampsia revealed low-grade proteinuria with a urine protein/creatinine ratio of 40 mg/mmol, as well as normal renal and liver function. Your vasculitic screen showed a normal C-reactive protein level of 3.8 mg/L, mildly elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 16 mm/h, and absence of antinuclear antibodies, antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibodies, anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies, and antiphospholipid antibodies. Does that sound correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's what the tests showed.\nDoctor: At 34 weeks, your ultrasound indicated that the estimated fetal weight was in the 94th percentile, and your placental vascular resistance was normal. Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's what they told me.\nDoctor: Thank you for the information. The differential diagnoses for your major finding of significant infrarenal aortic stenosis include congenital abdominal coarctation, Takayasu's arteritis, fibromuscular dysplasia, aortic neurofibromatosis, aortic tuberculosis, and radiation aortitis. In your case, the presence of a well-developed collateral vasculature suggests a chronic aortopathy.\nPatient: Okay, so what does that mean?\nDoctor: Since you don't have any clinical history or signs of neurofibromatosis, tuberculosis, or radiation exposure, and there is little evidence of active inflammation, the diagnosis could be chronic abdominal aortopathy from congenital abdominal aortic coarctation, fibromuscular dysplasia, or an inactive form of Takayasu's arteritis.

You were referred to our department for further evaluation and possible surgical treatment. We performed a Computed Tomography (CT) scan without contrast media, which revealed a gallstone in your thickened gallbladder wall. There was also a slight increase in the CT value due to surrounding panniculitis, as shown in Fig.\nPatient: Oh, I see. So what does that mean for me?\nDoctor: We also conducted an MRCP, which showed that your cystic duct is connected to an aberrant bile duct.

Have you had any prior medical conditions?\nPatient: Yes, I was diagnosed with hypertension and diabetes mellitus a few years ago and have been taking oral medication for their treatment.\nDoctor: Okay, let me explain what happened after your initial admission. After your clinical examination, you were diagnosed with coronary atherosclerotic heart disease. You underwent coronary angiography and stent implantation, and during the operation, heparin was administered, which included an arterial intrathecal injection of 2000 units and an intravenous injection of 3500 units.\nPatient: Alright.\nDoctor: After the angiography, we prescribed you aspirin (100 mg per day), TiGraylo (90 mg once every 12 h), and enoxaparin sodium (0.4 mL once every 12 h subcutaneously) for 3 days.

However, on the third day after the operation, you were diagnosed with hematochezia without abdominal pain.\nPatient: Oh, I see.\nDoctor: During the physical examination, we found mild abdominal tenderness, especially in your left lower quadrant, and some signs indicative of peritoneal irritation. There was also a neoplasm-like mucous clot connected to your bowel in the anus. We conducted some laboratory tests which showed declined levels of hemoglobin (102 g/L), prolonged prothrombin time (13.4 s), and an international normalized ratio of 1.2.\nPatient: What does that mean?\nDoctor: These results indicate some issues with your blood clotting. Moving on, we performed a colonoscopy and found a submucosal mass in your sigmoid colon, covered with a partially ruptured mucous membrane and some clots in the cavity, causing obstruction. An abdominal CT scan showed a submucosal hematoma in the sigmoid colon, and the density of the mass did not significantly change on an enhanced CT scan. The left flexure of the colon was also thick, which could be another hematoma.\nPatient: So, what's the treatment for this?\nDoctor: We tried conservative treatment, which included stopping your anticoagulant medications, providing total parenteral nutrition, and monitoring your condition.

Radiologists noted an air and faint oral contrast suggestion outside the suture line of the LAGB. An upper gastrointestinal (UGI) evaluation confirmed a residual contrast in the transverse and descending colon. The patient's white blood cell count was elevated at 18,000 cells/μl.\nA: The primary diagnosis is a pulmonary embolism secondary to a retained oral contrast outside the suture line of the LAGB. The patient's history of oesophagitis and gastritis post-LAGB surgery is also noted. The differential diagnosis includes other causes of pulmonary embolism, such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT), although imaging and clinical presentation support the initial diagnosis.\nP: The management plan includes close monitoring of the patient's condition, with regular follow-ups to assess the resolution of the pulmonary embolism and to manage any ongoing oesophageal issues. The patient will be educated on signs of complications and advised to report any new or worsening symptoms immediately. Further treatment for the pulmonary embolism will be determined based on the patient's recovery and recovery parameters. Compliance with prescribed medications and dietary restrictions will be emphasized to prevent future complications.

Your laboratory findings were not suspect for acute pancreatitis. However, we performed a contrast-enhanced CT scan to evaluate the known chronic pancreatitis and other potential causes of your pain.\nPatient: And what did the scan find?\nDoctor: The CT scan revealed a hypervascular lesion in the pancreatic tail, consisting of a conglomeration of small hypervascular spots and blood vessels. We needed to differentiate between a vascular malformation and a hypervascular pancreatic tumor, such as an islet cell tumor or a hypervascular metastasis.\nPatient: How did you do that?\nDoctor: We performed a contrast-enhanced MR study which showed a focal area of heterogeneous contrast enhancement without an apparent nodular component. The subsequent angiography revealed two large feeding arteries in the early arterial phase, followed by a racemose vascular network, an early transient dense parenchyma stain in the early portal phase, and early wash-out of the lesion in the portal phase.\nDoctor: Based on these findings, we diagnosed you with a pancreatic arteriovenous malformation.\nPatient: What does that mean for me, and what do I need to do now?\nDoctor: It means that there is an abnormal connection between the arteries and veins in your pancreas.

We'll need to do some laboratory examinations to further investigate your symptoms.\nPatient: Okay, what kind of tests will you do?\nDoctor: We'll start with a blood test to measure your beta hCG levels and perform a pelvic ultrasound. *After tests* Your beta hCG level is 118471 and the ultrasound has confirmed a 12-week viable intrauterine pregnancy. We'll admit you to the hospital for close monitoring.\nPatient: Alright, thank you.\nDoctor: During your hospital stay, you developed a massive pleural effusion, low-grade fever, progressive worsening abdominal pain, and a spontaneous abortion. We performed a non-contrast-enhanced computed tomography of your chest, which revealed a large right-sided pleural effusion. We also did a contrast-enhanced computed tomography of your abdomen and pelvis, which showed bilateral hilar adenopathy, ascites, thickening and enhancement of the peritoneum, and mottled nodular-appearing soft tissue, which is suspicious for peritoneal carcinomatosis.\nPatient: Oh no, what does that mean?\nDoctor: We consulted with surgical and oncology specialists for the possibility of exploratory laparotomy and discussed treatment options for presumed ovarian neoplasm. We also did more blood work, which revealed an elevated carbohydrate antigen (CA) 125 and a positive QuantiFERON-TB Gold test. However, your adenosine deaminase, CA 19, alpha-fetoprotein, and inhibin B levels are within normal limits.\nPatient: So, what's the next step?\nDoctor: We performed a diagnostic laparoscopy with biopsy, which revealed significant pelvis ascites and diffuse miliary lesions throughout the peritoneum. You then underwent dilatation and curettage. The histopathologic examination showed chronic granulomatous inflammation with no evidence of neoplasm.\nPatient: What does that mean for me?\nDoctor: Special stains on the tissue sections and ascitic fluid stain revealed rare acid-fast bacilli, which suggests mycobacterial granulomatous peritonitis. Upon further questioning, you indicated that you had a positive PPD skin test a year ago but didn't receive any follow-up treatment. We have started you on a four-drug anti-tuberculous therapy.\nPatient: Will that help me recover?\nDoctor: Yes, with the appropriate treatment, you should have a complete recovery.

Can you describe the symptoms you've been experiencing?\nPatient: Yeah, my right leg has been really swollen and painful. It's been difficult to walk around.\nDoctor: I understand. So, before your surgical thrombectomy, you received a suprarenal IVC filter due to the short distance between the thrombus in the distal IVC and the inflow of renal veins. The surgical access was established via venotomy of the common femoral vein, and an occlusion balloon was used for the thrombectomy. How did you feel after the procedure?\nPatient: I felt a bit better, but still had some pain and swelling in my leg.\nDoctor: Hmm, I see. In a follow-up CT, we found that the filter had dislodged and tilted towards the right IVC wall with its legs piercing the contralateral wall and extending into the left renal vein. This was likely due to the surgical thrombectomy. You were given oral anticoagulation with Warfarin, but unfortunately, there was a re-thrombosis. We then performed catheter-directed thrombolysis, including stenting of the common iliac veins and the IVC. However, we didn't attempt filter retrieval at that time due to the large amount of clot within the filter.\nPatient: Oh, I see. So, what happened next?\nDoctor: After 5 weeks of Warfarin therapy, you were scheduled for a retrieval, which was considered mandatory due to the displaced and tilted filter with penetrating legs. We introduced a 14-F sheath, an SOS catheter, a Bentson wire, and an EN Snare to create a loop. We attempted the single loop-snare technique several times, but it kept slipping around the filter legs.\nPatient: That sounds difficult. What did you do then?\nDoctor: To stabilize the loop, we formed a second loop using the same technique around the filter tip. With two loops around the filter tip, we were finally able to successfully pull the filter away from the wall and into the 14F sheath.\nPatient: That's a relief! What's the next step now?\nDoctor: A follow-up venography will be performed to ensure that the filter has been successfully removed and to monitor your condition.

Can you tell me what happened and what kind of injuries you sustained?\nPatient: Yeah, I had a pretty bad crash and ended up with a type II distal diaphyseal tibia fracture and a segmental fibula fracture. They checked my leg and found a 1 cm wound with some grass in it.\nDoctor: It looks like they performed a neurovascular assessment and didn't find any deficits, which is good. And they did an initial inspection of your leg to assess the wound. Did they do any treatment at that point?\nPatient: Yes, they cleaned the wound with irrigation and gave me IV cefazolin, gentamicin, and penicillin. They also applied a splint to my leg.\nDoctor: Good, those initial treatments are important. I see that you underwent intraoperative irrigation and debridement within the first 24 hours, and they placed a suprapatellar IMN. How did you feel after the surgery?\nPatient: I was okay at first. They gave me two doses of IV Ancef, and I was discharged with a nonweightbearing status on my injured leg.\nDoctor: I understand that you started to develop progressive knee discomfort over time. Can you describe the symptoms and when they began?\nPatient: Yeah, after about four weeks, I started to have severe pain in my knee. It got really swollen and red, and I could hardly move it.\nDoctor: It appears that at that juncture, an examination identified a large knee effusion, erythema, and minimal tolerance for knee range-of-motion. They also inspected the fracture site and found mild erythema with serosanguinous drainage. They aspirated the knee and found cloudy yellow fluid. The analysis showed a white cell count of over 100,000 with 96% neutrophils, and the cultures grew gram-negative rods. Your care was then transferred to me. \nPatient: Yeah, that's when things started to get really serious.\nDoctor: We decided to perform an I&D of the knee, fracture site, and intramedullary canal after removing the hardware. During the procedure, we found discolored fluid in the knee and palpable loculations in the suprapatellar pouch. We also found grass in the knee and at the fracture site. \nPatient: That must be why my knee was so infected.\nDoctor: Yes, the grass likely contributed to the infection. We performed a synovectomy to remove the loculated tissue in the knee, and we extended the surgical footprint at the fracture site to allow for debridement of the bone and soft tissue. We removed nonviable skin, which resulted in a 1x3 cm soft-tissue defect directly over the anteromedial tibial fracture site. \nPatient: What is the next step in my treatment?\nDoctor: We used a reamed irrigator aspirator (RIA) during the procedure, which will help with recovery. Going forward, we will closely monitor your healing process and address any complications that may arise. It's important that you continue to follow the nonweightbearing status on your injured leg and follow up with us regularly.\nPatient: Okay, I understand.

Your chest, cardiovascular, genital, neurologic, and extremities examinations were unremarkable.\nPatient: Okay, so what's next?\nDoctor: We'll need to conduct some laboratory studies. *After studies* Your leukocyte count is 15,000 × 109/L, and your eosinophil count is 800 cells × 109/L, which is higher than the normal level of less than 500 × 109/L. All other parameters of the complete blood count and differential markers of renal and hepatic function, including serum calcium, are within normal limits.\nPatient: What does that mean for me?\nDoctor: We also performed a chest radiograph, which showed no consolidation, effusion, or cardiomegaly. An abdominal ultrasound was done, but it was nondiagnostic. However, abdominal computed tomography (CT) imaging revealed the presence of an enlarged spleen measuring 16 × 7 × 6 cm with multiple hypodense lesions. The liver was reported to be normal without any evidence of hepatomegaly. No lymphadenopathy was seen on the imaging studies.\nPatient: That doesn't sound good. What could be causing all of this?\nDoctor: Your systemic symptoms along with the splenomegaly and multiple hypodense splenic lesions raise high suspicion for a primary hematologic malignancy or a primary splenic tumor. We performed a normal peripheral blood smear and a normal bone marrow examination to investigate further.\nPatient: What do the results show?\nDoctor: We also conducted a full-body positron emission tomography (PET) scan. The PET scan showed multiple hypermetabolic splenic lesions with an SUV of 13.0 and no pathologic uptake in any other areas.\nPatient: So, what's the next step?\nDoctor: We will need to consult with a specialist to determine the best course of action for your treatment.

What can be done about it?\nDoctor: We have been managing your cancer pain with oral opioid therapy. However, the metastasis of the cancer has caused obstructive jaundice and cholangitis, leading to septic shock. We performed an emergent endoscopic biliary stent placement to treat the obstructive jaundice.\nPatient: I see. And what about my blood pressure?\nDoctor: To maintain your blood pressure, we have been medicating you with a continuous infusion of noradrenaline at 0.2 μg/kg/min through a peripheral vein. However, due to the repeated placement of peripheral venous catheters, it has become difficult to identify adequate peripheral veins for placement and maintenance of indwelling catheters.\nPatient: Hmm, that sounds concerning.\nDoctor: In addition to this, your congestive heart failure has continued, causing ascites and edema of the lower extremities. You have also been experiencing orthopnea and have been unable to sleep at night. We requested anesthesiologists to secure a reliable venous line for you.\nPatient: So, what happened with the anesthesiologists?\nDoctor: They checked your groin and thighs but excluded the femoral vein as a candidate for central venous access due to massive edema of the thighs. They attempted to allow you to assume the supine or reverse Trendelenburg position, but these positions caused worsening of your dyspnea. You could only tolerate the sitting position.\nPatient: I remember that.

And is there any history of malignant disease in your family?\nPatient: No, I don't have any history of medical or surgical diseases, and there's no history of malignant disease in my family either.\nDoctor: Okay, let's do an initial clinical observation. *After examining the patient* You appear to be haemodynamically stable. I can feel a painless mass in your periumbilical region, left hypochondrium, and left flank. There's also evidence of low gastrointestinal bleeding, or hematochezia. We'll need to get some tests done to find the cause.\nPatient: Alright, what tests do I need?\nDoctor: First, let's check your haemoglobin. *After checking* Your initial haemoglobin value at admission is 133 g/dl. We'll also perform an emergency non-total colonoscopy to look for any gastrointestinal lesions that could cause the bleeding.\nPatient: Okay, let me know what you find.\nDoctor: *After colonoscopy* We didn't find any lesions during the colonoscopy. We'll need to perform an Angio-CT to get more information. *After Angio-CT* The scan showed a large exophytic mass, approximately 20 x 14 x 13 cm, arising from the 4th duodenal segment and first jejunal segment. It has vascularization provided from branches of the upper mesenteric artery, with vascular dilatations inside the tumor and apparent intratumoral bleeding.
